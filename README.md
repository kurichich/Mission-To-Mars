# Mission-To-Mars

## Project Overview
  Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

I got stuck at the end of Deliverable #1.  I'll continue to review and resubmit a completed project.
